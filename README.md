# 📚 Research Paper Classifier with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a comprehensive **research paper classification system** developed during the **Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2025**, where our team **emerged as one of the top 10 teams** out of 10,000 participants after three intense rounds of competition. 

**Machine Learning**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and an interactive **Streamlit-based UI** are combined to classify research papers into their target conferences while providing detailed reasoning for the classification. 🚀

## ✨ Key Features

1. **🎛️ Streamlit-Based User Interface**  
   - Upload research paper PDFs via an intuitive web application.
   - Receive **real-time conference classification** and detailed rationale.

2. **🤖 Machine Learning Classification**  
   - Trained classifiers like **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, and **Naive Bayes** for initial publishability checks.
   - Used a **voting classifier** for robust predictions.

3. **🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   - Integrated **Pathway’s Vector Store** for **semantic similarity search**, dynamically retrieving relevant reference papers.
   - Utilized **GeminiEmbedder** for creating high-quality embeddings and **TokenCountSplitter** for efficient chunking.
   - Enabled real-time updates of reference papers via the **Google Drive Connector**.

4. **🧠 AI-Powered Conference Classification**  
   - Integrated **Gemini AI** to classify papers and generate **explanations (rationale)** for transparency and accuracy.

5. **⚙️ Multithreaded Architecture**  
   - Developed a **multithreaded Vector Store Server** to ensure seamless querying and retrieval operations without interruptions.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **📤 Upload a Research Paper**:  
   Use the **Streamlit-based interface** to upload your research paper in PDF format.

2. **🔄 Preprocessing and Publishability Check**:  
   The system preprocesses the uploaded paper and predicts **publishability** using trained machine learning classifiers.

3. **🔗 Semantic Retrieval**:  
   Relevant reference papers are retrieved using **Pathway’s Vector Store** based on **semantic similarity**.

4. **📊 Classification and Rationale**:  
   The paper is classified into one of the **target conferences** (e.g., CVPR, EMNLP, NeurIPS, etc.) using **RAG**. The rationale is generated using **Gemini AI** for better transparency.

5. **✅ Results Display**:  
   The **Streamlit UI** displays the classification and reasoning in real-time for user review.
